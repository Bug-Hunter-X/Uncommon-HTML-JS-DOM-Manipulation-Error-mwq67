# Uncommon HTML/JavaScript DOM Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to DOM manipulation in JavaScript. The bug arises from attempting to access and modify an HTML element using JavaScript before the element has been fully parsed and added to the Document Object Model (DOM) by the browser. 

This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the JavaScript code appearing to execute without errors, but without producing any visible results.  The solution involves ensuring the element exists and is attached to the DOM before accessing it.  Please refer to the `bug.html` file for the buggy code and `bugSolution.html` for a corrected version.
